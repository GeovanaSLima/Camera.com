# 💻 How to Use It

## ⚠️ Requirements
Before starting, you'll need to have installed the following tools:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com)
* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Java SE Developpment Kit (JDK)](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
* Android Development Environment Setup - you can follow the [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for this setup.


Besides that, you're going to need a code editor of your preference. I am used to the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but you are free to choose.
